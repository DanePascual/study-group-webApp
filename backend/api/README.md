# API Routes

This directory will contain API endpoint definitions for the Study Group application.

## Planned Structure

```
api/
├── auth.js          # Authentication routes (login, signup, logout)
├── users.js         # User management routes
├── rooms.js         # Study room management routes
├── resources.js     # File upload and resource management routes
├── discussions.js   # Forum and discussion routes
└── reports.js       # Analytics and reporting routes
```

## Future Implementation

When implementing the backend, consider:
- Express.js for routing
- JWT for authentication
- File upload middleware for resources
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling middleware
