# Data Models

This directory will contain data model definitions and database schemas.

## Planned Models

```
models/
├── User.js          # User account and profile information
├── StudyRoom.js     # Study room data and settings
├── Resource.js      # Uploaded files and study materials
├── Discussion.js    # Forum topics and posts
├── Message.js       # Chat messages within study rooms
└── Report.js        # Analytics and usage reports
```

## Future Implementation

Consider using:
- Mongoose for MongoDB schemas
- Sequelize for SQL database models
- Data validation libraries
- Proper indexing for performance
- Relationship definitions between models
